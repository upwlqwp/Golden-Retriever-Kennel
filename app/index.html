      <h2 class="section-title">How Does Leasing Work?</h2>



      <p class="how-does__text">

        Leasing a vehicle is essentially entering into a long term rental

        agreement for that vehicle. Unlike a traditional car purchase, you donâ€™t

        actually own the vehicle. Instead, a leasing company purchases the

        vehicle from the dealer on your behalf and then you make monthly

        payments to the leasing company for the duration of your lease. Some

        leases however, do provide the option to purchase the vehicle at the end

        of the lease.

      </p>



      <h4 class="how-does__subtitle">

        Similar to a short term car rental, there are rules that define:

      </h4>



      <ol class="how-does-list">

        <li class="how-does-item">

          How much you can drive, stated as annual miles (excess miles are

          charged at a specified rate)

        </li>

        <li class="how-does-item">

          Types of damage that you may be liable for at the end of your lease

        </li>

        <li class="how-does-item">

          The procedures and costs when you return the vehicle at the end of

          your lease

        </li>

      </ol>



      <p class="how-does__text">

        Lease contracts are a commitment and ending them early can be difficult

        and expensive so it is important to consider your circumstances

        carefully before you decide.

                Each state in the U.S. has different guidelines in regards to

                guaranteed health for sold puppies. For states that do not have

                a mandatory health guarantee in place, any breeder advertising

                through our site is expected to cover the health of their

                puppies for at least 30 days. In the event that a state

                guideline is in place offering a guarantee longer than 30 days,

                that law holds precedence.

                For dogs with atopy, a vet visit is needed quickly to manage the

                itch and treat for any skin infection present. There are now

                very effective and safe anti-itch medications available (Apoquel

                and Cytopoint) that dogs with atopy can be on seasonally or

                year-round to relieve itchiness and help to prevent secondary

                skin infections.

                Your Golden Retriever will need a minimum of two hours of good

                exercise per day. It's best to spread this out across the day

                and include walks and lots of running, with extra playtime and

                training on top. You can find out how much exercise your dog

                needs, or even find exercises you can do together. Adult Golden

                Retrievers require a reasonable amount of exercise to keep them

                in top shape. Don't overexert puppies, otherwise bone or joint

                problems may occur. A couple of hours of exercise a day is

                enough for an adult dog, though he'll enjoy more if you can

                provide it!

                Hot spots can appear anywhere on the body but most commonly are

                found near the ears, the underside of the neck, or on the hips

                of a Golden Retriever. Hot spots usually resolve quickly with a

                combination of topical and oral medication prescribed by a

                veterinarian. To help prevent hot spots, itâ€™s important to keep

                your Golden Retriever current on flea and tick prevention, make

                sure they are thoroughly dried off after swimming or a bath, and

                identify and treat underlying issues like allergies.

                Golden Retrievers can consume a wide variety of healthy and

                nutritious foods. Proteins â€“ beef, chicken, lamb, pork, and

                salmon; grains â€“ wheat, oats, corn, and rice; dairy such as

                plain yogurt and cheese; vegetables; peas, pumpkin, carrots;

                fruits such as apples and berries are just a few examples. Large

                breeds of dogs with large appetites require a different mix of

                nutrients, including minerals and vitamins, compared to smaller

                dogs. Golden Retrievers are prone to flatulence and stomach

                problems. To reduce the risk of these problems, a more frequent

                and divided diet is recommended.

              </p>

              <p>

                The exact nutritional requirements will depend on many factors,

                such as the stage of life, breed, size, level of activity, and

                overall dog health. For example, an energetic and growing puppy

                may need twice the calories of an adult dog of the same breed.

                Elderly dogs may need 20% fewer calories than middle-aged dogs.

                For instance, my well-exercised dog needs an entirely different

                diet and nutrition than a toy breed that likes to laze around

                all day, and a pregnant pooch needs many more calories than that

                same inactive lap dog.

                Golden Retrievers shed all year long, but typically shed more in

                the spring and fall when their coats change. Ideally, your

                Golden Retriever should be brushed daily to improve shedding.

                Regular use of an undercoat rake can also be a big help for you

                (and your couch). The Golden Retriever's thick coat requires

                regular care. The undercoat has a water repellent function and

                is therefore very thick. But it must not be allowed to fall off:

                tangles cause discomfort to the animal. Although the long coat

                quickly collects water and dirt, when it dries, it is quite easy

                to clean.

              </p>

              <p>

                Golden Retrievers have fur rather than hair. They have a double

                coat that provides two levels of fur that are shed throughout

                the year. All dogs that have the double coat like the Golden

                Retriever will have hair rather than fur, which means you can

                expect a moderate to high amount of shedding.
