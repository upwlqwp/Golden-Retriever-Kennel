      Depending on your circumstances and what is important to you, a lease
      could be a great option for your next vehicle. Below are some important
      factors that may influence your decision.

        <p class="important__item-text">
          Each state in the U.S. has different guidelines in regards to
                  guaranteed health for sold puppies. For states that do not
                  have a mandatory health guarantee in place, any breeder
                  advertising through our site is expected to cover the health
                  of their puppies for at least 30 days. In the event that a
                  state guideline is in place offering a guarantee longer than
                  30 days, that law holds precedence.

        <h4 class="important__item-subtitle">Physical Exercise</h4>
        <p class="important__item-text">
          Your Golden Retriever will need a minimum of two hours of good
          exercise per day. It's best to spread this out across the day
          and include walks and lots of running, with extra playtime and
          training on top. You can find out how much exercise your dog
          needs, or even find exercises you can do together. Adult
          Golden Retrievers require a reasonable amount of exercise to
          keep them in top shape. Don't overexert puppies, otherwise
          bone or joint problems may occur. A couple of hours of
          exercise a day is enough for an adult dog, though he'll enjoy
          more if you can provide it!

        <h4 class="important__item-subtitle">  Nutrition</h4>
        <p class="important__item-text">
          Golden Retrievers can consume a wide variety of healthy and
                  nutritious foods. Proteins – beef, chicken, lamb, pork, and
                  salmon; grains – wheat, oats, corn, and rice; dairy such as
                  plain yogurt and cheese; vegetables; peas, pumpkin, carrots;
                  fruits such as apples and berries are just a few examples.
                  Large breeds of dogs with large appetites require a different
                  mix of nutrients, including minerals and vitamins, compared to
                  smaller dogs. Golden Retrievers are prone to flatulence and
                  stomach problems. To reduce the risk of these problems, a more
                  frequent and divided diet is recommended.

        <h4 class="important__item-subtitle">Hair Care</h4>
        <p class="important__item-text">
          Golden Retrievers shed all year long, but typically shed more
                  in the spring and fall when their coats change. Ideally, your
                  Golden Retriever should be brushed daily to improve shedding.
                  Regular use of an undercoat rake can also be a big help for
                  you (and your couch). The Golden Retriever's thick coat
                  requires regular care. The undercoat has a water repellent
                  function and is therefore very thick. But it must not be
                  allowed to fall off: tangles cause discomfort to the animal.
                  Although the long coat quickly collects water and dirt, when
                  it dries, it is quite easy to clean.
